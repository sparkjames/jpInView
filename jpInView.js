 * Simple checker for the question "is an element in view?"

 * Add the 'inView' class to your elements, this script will
 * loop through them to see if they are in the widow enough
 * to be considered "in view". If they are they get the class
 * "is-inView" and "touched-inView". The class "is-inView" is
 * removed when an element is no longer in view, but the
 * "touched-inView" class will remain.

/*
 * You can modify the percentage of the window you want to
 * consider "in view". This is the threshold where an element
 * must scroll into this area before it is in view.
 *
 * For example, if the window is 900px in height, then 80% of
 * the screen is 720px. So a section would have to be
 * within that 720px to get the 'is-inView' class applied to
 * it.
